## About this fork

I've used the remote-control features in Claude Code and in Oh My Pi (OMP)
and found both genuinely useful — being able to walk away from my computer
and still drive a session, or hand it off entirely, is a real workflow
upgrade. What I kept running into with OMP was that its terminal proxy
server isn't something you can self-host, which bugged me on both privacy
and safety grounds: a session with control over my machine, brokered by
infrastructure I don't run. So this fork adds the same kind of remote
control to maki, plus a self-hosted proxy (what we call the anchor) so the
whole path stays under your own roof.

This fork adds remote control over the web, built for running maki on many
hosts with one shared entry point:

* **`/rc` standalone** - run `/rc` in the TUI and it prints a tokenized web URL
  (behind your own reverse proxy for TLS). The web view mirrors the live
  session: full transcript, thinking, tool calls with results, model, context
  and cost stats. You can prompt, answer permission requests, and stop runs
  from the browser.
* **File explorer** - a git-aware file panel slides out from the terminal
  page: gitignore-respecting tree, per-file status badges, markdown
  rendering with a raw-source toggle, unified diffs (tracked or untracked),
  and a save path straight back to disk over the same tunnel.
* **`maki-anchor`** - a central server for many instances. Instances dial out
  over a WebSocket, so they need no inbound ports. One domain, one dashboard,
  one login:
  * OIDC single sign-on (Authelia, Authentik, Keycloak, Pocket ID, ...), first
    login becomes admin.
  * Per-user, per-instance grants: `viewer` (read) or `controller` (prompt and
    approve).
  * Share links with rights and expiry: `view` / `control`, default 2 hours.
  * Fleet dashboard: all instances, their sessions, costs, and status.
    Login is mandatory (first run walks you through creating the admin), and
    the link to your instance reconnects itself when the network blinks.
  * Full session transcripts are persisted on the anchor for fast reload and
    search, with per-session delete, off-the-record (OTR, never persisted),
    and a configurable pruning timeline.
* **Signed Windows binaries** - releases ship an Authenticode-signed `.exe`
  (Azure Trusted Signing), so SmartScreen stays quiet, next to static Linux
  (x86_64 + arm64) and macOS builds.

Quick start for the anchor:

```sh
# On the server: install or update maki-anchor as a systemd service.
# As root it writes a system unit; as a user, a user unit with linger.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wmantly/maki/main/install-anchor.sh | sh

# Register an instance and copy the printed one-liner for its host.
maki-anchor tokens add work-laptop

# A CLI-minted instance has no grants yet, so it's invisible on a non-admin's
# dashboard until you grant one. Either do it in one step:
maki-anchor tokens add work-laptop --user-id 2 --rights control
# ...or grant it after the fact (see `maki-anchor users list` for ids):
maki-anchor grants set 2 work-laptop control
```

```sh
# Or skip systemd and run in the foreground
# (reverse proxy handles TLS and forwards WebSocket upgrades).
maki-anchor serve --bind 0.0.0.0:8688
```

```lua
-- In ~/.config/maki/init.lua on the instance host.
maki.setup {
  anchor = {
    url = "https://maki.example.com",
    name = "work-laptop",
    token = "<token from tokens add>",
  },
}
```

Now `/rc` prints an anchor link instead of binding a local port. See the
[anchor docs](https://maki.sh/docs/anchor/) for SSO setup, grants, and share
links.

An AI coding agent optimized for minimal use of context tokens, while providing a great user experience.

## Features

### Context efficiency

* `index` tool - uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) to parse supported programming languages to produce a high level skeleton of a file, with exact start-end lines of each item (e.g. a function's implementation is in lines 150-165). Encouraged to be used before reads. For my usage it adds 59 tok/turn but saves 224 tok/turn on read calls, saving 165 tok/turn.
* `code_execution` tool - uses [monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) to run an interpreter that has all other tools available as async functions. Maki uses it to filter / summarize / transform / pipe data to other tools as input, without it ever reaching and polluting the context window. Sandbox limited by time & memory.
* `task` tool - when delegating work to subagents, the AI chooses whether to run weak / medium / strong model of used provider. Think haiku / sonnet / opus.
* System prompt, tool descriptions, and tool examples are all concise, I've made sure not to bloat your context.
* Uses [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) if you have it installed, disable with `maki.setup({ agent = { rtk = false } })` in your `init.lua`. Saves ~50% of bash output tokens. Remember bash is just 12% of total token usage, so 6% is nice, but saving on reads (65% of total) by using `index` gave me more benefit. I think I'll do bash output filtering like this myself in a future release.

### User experience

* SUPER fast startup, 60 FPS, and light on memory. Not running any JavaScript, using [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) for TUI. Even the splash screen animation uses SIMD.
* Extend with neovim like Lua plugins - [Builtin plugins](https://github.com/tontinton/maki/tree/main/plugins), [User made plugins showcase](https://github.com/tontinton/maki/discussions/452), [Lua API reference](https://maki.sh/docs/lua-api/).
* Philosophy of not hiding anything - while other coding agents hide information as models improve (e.g. not showing number of lines read), maki leaves you in control.
* UI fits everything well on my small screen laptop.
* Full visibility of subagents - each subagent gets their own "chat window" you can easily navigate between using `/tasks` (Ctrl-X).
* Sensible permission system - when the agent runs `git diff && rm -rf /`, what do you think will happen in your current coding agent? It will treat it as `git *`. Maki uses tree-sitter to parse the bash command and figure out the permissions requested are `git *` and `rm *`. Disable using `--yolo`.
* SSRF protection on `webfetch` calls.
* A `memory` tool to keep long term context, just tell maki to remember something (sometimes it uses it automatically). Managed via `/memory` (view / edit / delete memories).
* Fuzzy search with Ctrl-F.
* `/btw` to run a command with the chat history without interfering with the current session.
* Rewind on Escape-Escape (no code rewind yet, only chat history).
* Attach images in prompts.
* 26 of the most popular themes.
* Resume sessions.
* Skills & MCPs.
* Opt-in [OpenTelemetry](https://maki.sh/docs/telemetry/) export, same format as Claude Code's.
* Plan mode.
* Run bash commands using `!`, or `!!` if you want maki to not know about it.
* `/cd` to change dir.
* Use `--print --output-format stream-json` to run UI-less. Output is compatible with Claude Code, so you can easily replace your existing solutions (although I wouldn't recommend that, maki is very new).

## Supported providers

**Dynamic providers** - drop an executable script into `~/.config/maki/providers/` to add custom providers or proxies. See [docs](https://maki.sh/docs/providers/#dynamic-providers) for details.

## Installation

### Linux / macOS

```sh
# Download and read the script first (don't blindly trust shell scripts).
curl -fsSL https://maki.sh/install.sh -o install.sh
cat install.sh

# Then run.
chmod +x install.sh && sh install.sh
```

One-liner:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://maki.sh/install.sh | sh
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin`. Override with `MAKI_INSTALL_DIR`.

## Example config

[tontinton/makiconf](https://github.com/tontinton/makiconf) - includes a [semble](https://github.com/MinishLab/semble) tool (Lua code) for semantic code search, and an [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io) MCP server for AST-based search and replace.

> DISCLAIMER: >90% of code in maki was written by maki, guided by humans. Some parts of the code are not as good as what I would've made in the artisanal hand-made style. But it's also not slop / vibe coded, and can easily be refactored if needed nowadays.
