//! Feeds monty's memory counters so `max_memory` holds in-process.
//!
//! monty v0.0.21 checks `LIVE_MEMORY - BASELINE_MEMORY` at VM checkpoints,
//! but something must feed those counters. Upstream feeds them with
//! `monty-alloc` in a throwaway worker process that dies on a breach. maki
//! runs the interpreter in-process, so this allocator does the accounting
//! instead: it charges allocations made by a thread holding a
//! [`SandboxScope`], and monty's tracker turns a breach into a plain
//! Python `MemoryError`.
//!
//! Being the `#[global_allocator]` of every binary that links this crate
//! (a second one anywhere fails to compile), enforcement can never go
//! silently missing. Outside a scope each allocation pays one thread-local
//! read and touches nothing shared.
//!
//! The counters are process-wide, so overlapping runs share one budget:
//! only the outermost rebases the baseline, and the tightest `max_memory`
//! wins. Serializing instead would deadlock, because a script suspended in
//! a `task` call holds its scope while the subagent it waits on starts a
//! run of its own.
//!
//! The accounting is approximate: tool results are allocated on other
//! threads (never charged) yet often freed inside the scope (refunded), so
//! a large result grants that much unearned headroom. Good enough as a
//! guardrail against runaway agent code, not a security boundary. Once
//! monty ships `set_memory_probe` (pydantic/monty#740) the counter becomes
//! thread-local and the sharing and rebasing go away.
