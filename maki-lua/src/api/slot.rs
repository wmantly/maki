/// Add a layer around an existing (or future) slot. Layers wrap the

/// Calling `prev` more than once throws.
///
/// You can call this before the owner runs `declare_slot`. The layer
/// is queued and attached when the slot is declared.
///
/// A layer may park, and one that throws is skipped: the chain continues
/// as if it had returned `prev(...)` untouched, so a broken layer never
/// takes the seam down with it.
///
/// Layers wrap in registration order, so the last one registered runs
/// first and sees the value before the others do.
///
/// Maki fires two slots around the plan form, both with
/// `ev = { path, session }`. `ui.plan_form.actions` asks for the form's
/// menu, and `ui.plan_form` asks whether the form opens at all. Both are
/// documented under [maki.plan](/docs/lua-api/#maki-plan).
///
/// Maki fires two slots per tool itself: `tool.<name>.input` before
/// permissions look at the call, and `tool.<name>.output` on the text it
/// produced. Both take `function(prev, value, ctx)` and answer with a
/// table to replace the value, nothing to leave it alone, or
/// `nil, reason` to stop the call. Wrapping one costs the capability the
/// tool declares, and a tool declaring none costs every permission. See
/// [Hooks](/docs/hooks/).
///
/// Wrapping a slot another plugin declared steers a chain that plugin's
/// callers trust, so it costs whatever the owner priced it at in
/// `declare_slot`: the capabilities it named, every permission if it named
/// none, or nothing at all if it declared its arguments inert. Layering a slot
/// you declared yourself is free. Like the `tool.*` slots, this is decided
/// when the chain fires: the call skips a layer that is not entitled and
/// carries on, and a reload that changes what you hold takes effect on the
/// next call.
///
/// @param name string Slot name to wrap.
/// @param wrapper function Layer: `function(prev, ...)`. Call `prev(...)` to continue.
/// @return
/// @example
/// maki.api.set_slot("myplugin.render", function(prev, text)
///   return prev("[" .. text .. "]")
