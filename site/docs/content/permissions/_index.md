# Permissions

Maki uses a permission system to decide what each tool is allowed to do and when to ask you first.

Whether a project's `.maki` configuration loads at all is a separate question,
answered once per folder. See [folder trust](/docs/folder-trust/).

## Rule Layers

Rules come from four layers, combined for resolution:

1. **Session rules**, set during the current session (in-memory only)
2. **Config rules**, loaded from TOML permission files
3. **Builtin rules**, the hardcoded defaults
4. **Plugin rules**, declared by plugins via [`maki.api.register_permission_rule`](/docs/lua-api/#maki-api-register_permission_rule)

Any matching deny blocks the tool. No exceptions, so a config deny always beats a plugin allow.

A [`tool.<name>.input` hook](/docs/hooks/) runs before any of this. Rules are
resolved against the call as the hook left it, so what the prompt shows you is
what runs.

## Check Flow

For every tool call, each scope resolves like this:

```
tool call
    │
deny rule matches?  ── yes ──►  blocked. no exceptions
    │ no
allow rule matches? ── yes ──►  runs
    │ no
YOLO active?        ── yes ──►  runs
    │ no
plan file write?    ── yes ──►  runs
    │ no
    ▼
default: prompt / allow / deny
```

Deny rules are checked across all layers before anything else, so a deny cannot be bypassed by YOLO or the plan-file auto-allow. In plan mode, writes to any path other than the plan file are rejected before this flow; this applies to the file-write tools only. All other tools, including MCP tools, follow the check flow below as usual. `default` resolves per-tool first, then global; the built-in default is `"prompt"`.

## Builtin Defaults

File-write tools are pre-allowed inside the project working directory (cwd at session start, canonicalized). Paths outside that tree still need a prompt or an explicit allow rule:

| Tool | Scope | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `write` | `<cwd>/**` | Outside cwd requires permission |
| `edit` | `<cwd>/**` | Outside cwd requires permission |
| `multiedit` | `<cwd>/**` | Outside cwd requires permission |
| `edit_lines` | `<cwd>/**` | Outside cwd requires permission |
| `insert_lines` | `<cwd>/**` | Same, when the opt-in tool is enabled |
| `task` | `*` | Subagent spawning always allowed |

The memory plugin uses a plugin rule to pre-allow the file-write tools inside its notes directory (under maki's state dir), so the agent can edit memory notes directly without a prompt.

These tools have no builtin allow rule, so they prompt (or follow your `default`) every time unless you add rules:

- `bash` - Shell commands (scopes come from tree-sitter parsing)
- `websearch` - Web search queries
- `webfetch` - URL fetching

Tools that never declare permission scopes (for example `read`, `glob`, `grep`, `index`, `memory`, `skill`, `todo_write`) **skip** the permission manager entirely. They always run. If you need to block one of them, turn the plugin off in `init.lua` (`plugins.read = { enabled = false }`) rather than using `permissions.toml`.

Container tools like `batch` and `code_execution` prompt for each inner tool individually.

## TOML Configuration

There are two permission files:

- **Global**: `~/.config/maki/permissions.toml`
- **Project**: `.maki/permissions.toml` in the active Git checkout, or in the
  working directory outside Git (takes precedence over global)

The project file's `deny` scopes always apply. The rest of it waits on
[folder trust](/docs/folder-trust/).

```toml
default = "deny"

[bash]
allow = [
    "cargo *",
    "git *",
]
deny = [
    "rm -rf *",
    "sudo *",
]

[read]
default = "allow"

[mcp.deepwiki]
allow = ["search", "fetch"]

[mcp.github]
deny = ["admin_delete"]
```

Each tool gets its own section with `allow` and `deny` arrays. Values are glob-like scope patterns.

> **Note:** In MCP server sections (`[mcp.*]`), the boolean forms `allow = true` and `deny = true` are deprecated and ignored. Use `default = "allow"` or `default = "deny"` instead. For native tool sections (e.g. `[bash]`), `allow = true` still works.

### The `default` key

Controls what happens when no allow or deny rule matches. Can be `"prompt"` (built-in default), `"deny"`, or `"allow"`. Set it globally or per-tool:

```toml
default = "deny"

[bash]
default = "prompt"
allow = ["cargo *"]
```

Here everything is denied by default, except `bash` which still prompts, and `cargo *` commands which are allowed.

Project files **cannot** set `default = "allow"` (top-level, per-tool, or MCP).
That value is ignored so a repository cannot grant itself full access. Project
**allow lists** work once the folder is [trusted](/docs/folder-trust/). Put
`default = "allow"` only in the global file.

## Scope Patterns

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|--------|
| `*` or `**` | Any value (full wildcard) |
| `prefix*` | Values starting with prefix |
| `cmd *` | Bare `cmd` or `cmd` plus args (`pwd *` matches `pwd` and `pwd -L`, not `pwdx`) |
| `dir/**` | `dir` itself or anything under it (path-aware on Windows and Unix) |
| `exact` | Exact match only |

## MCP Tool Permissions

MCP tools use natural TOML nesting. Server names are table keys under `[mcp]`, tool names are array values:

```toml
# Global permissions.toml (default = "allow" is ignored in project files)
[mcp.deepwiki]
allow = ["search", "fetch"]

[mcp.github]
deny = ["admin_delete"]

[mcp.lean-lsp]
default = "allow"               # allow all tools on this server (global only)
```

Tool names must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$` (no dots, max 64 chars). Server names cannot contain dots.

## Permission Prompts

When a gated tool needs permission, Maki asks you.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` | Allow once (immediate) |
| `s` | Allow for this session (confirm with `Enter` or `y`; any other key cancels) |
| `a` | Always allow for this project (confirm; saved to `.maki/permissions.toml`) |
| `A` | Always allow globally (confirm; saved to `~/.config/maki/permissions.toml`) |
| `n` | Open deny guidance editor (type optional guidance, then `Enter` to deny once; `Esc` cancels) |
| `d` | Deny always for this project (confirm; saved to `.maki/permissions.toml`) |
| `D` | Deny always globally (confirm) |

Session and always-allow / always-deny choices need a second key (`Enter` or `y`) so a fat-finger does not rewrite your rules. Deny-once with `n` lets you type a short reason the agent will see.

The keys are the same in a folder you have not
[trusted](/docs/folder-trust/), where `a` and `d` last for the session instead
of reaching `.maki/permissions.toml`.

ACP clients offer the four options the protocol defines. "Allow always" lasts
for the session, and "Reject always" is a project answer that follows folder
trust like the TUI, reading "Reject for this session" in an untrusted folder.

### Scope Generalization

When you pick "always allow" (or always deny for MCP), the saved scope is generalized so it stays useful beyond that one call:

- **bash**: `cargo test --all` becomes `cargo *`
- **write / edit / multiedit / edit_lines / insert_lines**: `/path/to/file.rs` becomes `/path/to/**`
- **MCP tools**: always `*` (per-tool, so allowing `deepwiki.search` will not cover `deepwiki.fetch`)
- **webfetch / websearch** (and anything else gated): the exact URL or query string is stored as-is

For MCP tools, both allow and deny decisions generalize to `*` (the entire tool). MCP inputs are opaque JSON with no meaningful scope pattern. Denying a single MCP invocation denies that tool until you revoke the rule.

## YOLO Mode

To skip prompts on gated tools, toggle YOLO with `/yolo`, or run with `--yolo`. Explicit deny rules still apply. The status bar shows `[yolo]` while it is on, and `/yolo` is stored with the session, so a resume comes back the same way. `--yolo` only sets the starting value for sessions you never toggled. Tools that never declare permission scopes are unaffected (they never prompted).

To start in YOLO mode every time:

```lua
-- ~/.config/maki/init.lua
maki.setup({
    always_yolo = true,
})
```

## Bash Command Parsing

Bash commands get parsed with tree-sitter to extract individual commands. Something like `cd /tmp && cargo test` is checked as two separate commands.

Some constructs are too complex to analyze statically, so they always trigger a prompt:

- Command substitution: `$(...)`, backticks
- Process substitution: `<(...)`, `>(...)`
- Subshells: `(...)`
- Arithmetic expansion: `$((...))`

Brace groups `{ ... }` and control flow (`if`, `for`, …) are segmented when possible; they do not by themselves force a prompt the way substitutions do.

## Plugin Permissions

Lua plugins have a separate, unrelated gate. A `plugin.toml` manifest next to the Lua file controls which gated `maki.*` APIs it may call. No manifest means every gated call is denied, including for your own `init.lua`. The [Lua API reference](/docs/lua-api/#plugin-permissions) documents the manifest and lists every permission.

It runs after [folder trust](/docs/folder-trust/) has let the Lua file load, and
limits which APIs the file reaches rather than sandboxing the file.

## Network Addresses

`webfetch`, `websearch` and every plugin that calls `maki.net` go through one guard. A request to a private, loopback or link-local address is refused, and so is a redirect that lands on one. The model picks these URLs, so a page it reads could otherwise talk it into fetching `http://169.254.169.254/` or an admin panel on your LAN.

To reach a service on your own machine or network, list it in [`net.allowed_private_hosts`](/docs/configuration/#net). An allowed host also keeps plain `http://` instead of being upgraded to `https://`, since a service on your LAN rarely has a certificate.

## Session Persistence

When you save a session, its permission rules are saved too. Loading the session restores them.
