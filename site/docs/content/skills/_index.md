# Skills

A skill is a short Markdown how-to that the agent loads only when it needs it. The `skill` tool shows the agent what is available, and when it picks one, the file drops into the conversation and the agent follows it.

Write one for anything you keep explaining: how you cut a release, how you write a maki plugin, how a PR should look in this repo. `AGENTS.md` is always in context and always costs tokens. A skill costs nothing until it is loaded, only its name and description sit in the tool list. So big skills are fine.

## Where skills live

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` inside. Maki looks for them every time the `skill` tool runs (and once at startup, to build the list). When two skills share a name, the one found last wins:

1. The builtin `maki-plugin-dev` (if enabled)
2. `~/.config/maki/skills/` (Windows: `%APPDATA%\maki\skills\`)
3. `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`
4. In your project, walking from the current directory up to the `.git` root, at each step: `.maki/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`

So project skills beat personal ones, and a skill at the repo root beats one with the same name deeper down. The `.claude`, `.opencode` and `.agents` dirs are there so skills you already wrote for other agents keep working.

[Folder trust](/docs/folder-trust/) does not gate skills. Every project skill
name and description is in the system prompt from startup, trusted or not, so
read a repository's skills before you work in it.

Only `SKILL.md` is read. If you want extra notes, put them in files next to it and link them from the body, like `./notes.md`.

## Writing one

Make a directory under `.maki/skills/` and put a `SKILL.md` in it:

```
.maki/skills/git-release/SKILL.md
```

```markdown
---
name: git-release
description: Cut a tagged release and open the changelog PR
---

## Steps

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` and the commits since the last tag.
2. Propose a semver bump and a short release summary.
3. Only tag after the user confirms.
```

The frontmatter is optional. Without it, the directory name is the skill name and the whole file is the body. An empty body is skipped. The `description` is what the model reads when picking a skill, so make it specific.

## How it gets used

The `skill` tool lists every skill it found, the agent calls it with a name and gets the body back. A wrong name errors and reprints the list so the model can pick again.

Skills are not slash commands: typing `/git-release` does nothing unless you also add a [custom command](/docs/commands/#custom-commands). Ask the agent to use a skill, or let it pick one on its own.

## The builtin: maki-plugin-dev

Maki ships one skill, `maki-plugin-dev`. It teaches the agent how to write maki Lua plugins, and on load it writes the full Lua API reference to a file in the state dir, so the agent can read it in pieces instead of swallowing it whole. It carries the same guide you can read in [Plugins](/docs/plugins/), so "write me a plugin that ..." is usually enough. Turn it off if you never write plugins:

```lua
-- ~/.config/maki/init.lua
maki.setup({
    plugins = {
        skill = { plugin_dev = false },
    },
})
```
